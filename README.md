# Object-Detection
Object detection can use image classification to identify a certain class of image and then detect and tabulate their appearance in an image or video. For examples include detecting damages on an assembly line or identifying machinery that requires maintenance.

Object Detection is an integration of information obtained from static and dynamic objects. This
Technology mainly contributes to the emergence of the so-called security and surveillance
operation over the Internet.

The main principle which is used in this project is the machine learning-based approach and
computer vision through which we can catch the objects in camera or video. Object detection is
widely used to recognize objects from the particular image that appears and is used to classify
them along with their labels. These features are then fed into a regression model that predicts the
location of the objects on the basis of their classification.
