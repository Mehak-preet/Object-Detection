# Object-Detection
Object detection can use image classification to identify a certain class of image and then detect and tabulate their appearance in an image or video. For examples include detecting damages on an assembly line or identifying machinery that requires maintenance.

Object Detection is an integration of information obtained from static and dynamic objects. This
Technology mainly contributes to the emergence of the so-called security and surveillance
operation over the Internet.

The main principle which is used in this project is the machine learning-based approach and
computer vision through which we can catch the objects in camera or video. Object detection is
widely used to recognize objects from the particular image that appears and is used to classify
them along with their labels. These features are then fed into a regression model that predicts the
location of the objects on the basis of their classification.

Some of the applications of Object Detection are

●	Video Surveillance: It is one of the major applications of object tracking. Video Surveillance is the activity that keeps on checking all the behaviors and activities happening around. If any illegal or improper behavior is seen then we can call security. It can be seen in automated CCTV surveillance.
●	Autonomous vehicles: As we know nowadays vehicles are coming in autopilot mode like Tesla Cars, so there we need this technology for the car computer to detect all the obstacles between the road and people.
●	Crowd Counting: It helps us to count any object or even people in any event or festival.
●	Tracking Objects: We can track any object or anything with this.
●	Security: It is used for security purposes and is an advanced method of security. For access control verification and identification of authentic users, it can also be installed in banks and cooperative sectors.
●	Military Purposes: For the safety of our military and country, It can be proved very beneficial as they can detect any illegal activity and any terrorist coming from Border
●	Agriculture Sector: It can be useful in the agriculture sector as well
●	Robots Vision: Robots need this technology as well to be more dynamic and improved.
●	Bomb Detection: This can be one of the most important applications. By inserting /placing this software in a pen or eyeglasses, we can detect  any anonymous thing in a market, city, or military basement.
